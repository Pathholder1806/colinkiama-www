## Why are you writing about this?

Vala has been my main language for a couple of months now.

I've gotten familiar with some people in the community (yes there is more than 5 of us lol).
<!-- TODO: What are your thoughts about the language,its criticsm (make sure you link that crticism from the GNOME dev) its community, what you've achieved with the lanaguage and in the community so far and most imprtantly in the end, ensure that people should give the same energy in how they treat and consider langauges. It's important to understand that not every language is developed in the same way, especially Vala which has deep hooks to GNOME libraries with options to be built upon other bindings (posix and dova (now deprecated)) -->
